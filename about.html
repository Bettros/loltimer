                <h2>About LoLTime</h2>

                <p>Welcome to LoLTime, your simple, no-nonsense timer for *League of Legends*.</p>
                
                <p>As dedicated players ourselves, we grew tired of digging through news articles, social media feeds, or logging into the game client just to find one simple piece of information: **"When does this Ranked Split actually end?"**</p>
                
                <p>We created this site to be the fastest, cleanest answer to that question. Our mission is to provide a single, focused tool that gives you the key dates at a glance, whether you're on your phone or desktop. No clutter, no pop-ups, just the time.</p>

                <h3>How It Works</h3>
                <p>To ensure accuracy, our site uses a semi-automatic system:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Ranked Split Timer:</strong> This timer is updated manually based on official announcements from Riot Games.</li>
                    <li><strong>Next Patch Timer:</strong> This timer is powered by a community-driven API to provide automatic updates for the next patch. If the API fails, we have a fallback date to ensure the timer is never broken.</li>
                </ul>
